## About the exercise

- The **array-cardio-exercise** is a simple exercise built with **_VanillaJS_** that approaches JS Array Functions.

## The functionality

It's pretty simple to understand. 
This exercise has 1 file, the index.html with all the functions inside of the script tag.
- In the **index.html** I set all the basic informations and also the the JS in the <script> tag, over there you will see several functions such as 'filter', 'map', 'reduce' and 'sort' followed by some examples to simplify an understanding of each one of them.
